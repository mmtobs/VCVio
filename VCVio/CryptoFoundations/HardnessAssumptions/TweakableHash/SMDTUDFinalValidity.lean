# Source-final-validity SM-DT-UD

SM-DT-UD asks an adversary to distinguish sampled images of one tweakable hash from samples of
an explicit output distribution. The public seed is sampled by the experiment and withheld while
the adversary selects target tweaks through the challenge oracle and evaluates the shared hash
collection. The seed is revealed only after those oracles have been removed.

In the real world, a challenge at `t` samples `x ← inputGen` from the subspace `M'` and returns
`th.eval pk t (emb x)`. In the ideal world it returns `y ← outputGen`. Both worlds answer and
record every query. The sticky final-validity monitor checks the target cap, distinct target
tweaks, and target/collection disjointness only in the experiment's final conjunction; repeated
collection-only tweaks remain valid. These declarations live in
`TweakableHash.SM_DT_UD_SourceFinalValidity` so that the winning semantics are visible at every
public use site.

The subspace the hidden input is drawn from is carried as its own type `M'` together with an
injective `emb : M' → M`, matching `TweakableHash.SM_DT_PRE_Problem`. A subspace carved out of `M`
by a predicate is the case `M' := Subtype p`, `emb := Subtype.val` (`Subtype.val_injective`); the
unrestricted notion is recovered exactly at `M' := M`, `emb := id` (`Function.injective_id`), so
the parameterization costs no generality. It buys the ability to state bounds in `|M'|` rather than
`|M|`. `Problem.HasUniformInputs` and `Problem.HasUniformOutputs` identify the distributional
instance in which the hidden input is uniform on the subspace and the ideal response is uniform on
the output space. A strict subspace is the case a reduction meets when the challenge must be
distributed as the value it replaces — a digest, for a hash chain.

These distributional predicates do not identify the final-validity presentation with the
rejection-on-arrival presentation in which an invalid challenge query returns no answer. Relating
the two presentations for SM-DT-UD requires a separate game conversion.

The source security quantity is oriented: `DirectedAdvantage` is the signed real gap
`Pr[real = true] - Pr[ideal = true]`. It can be negative, so swapping the real and ideal worlds is
observable. `AbsoluteAdvantage` separately provides the symmetric ENNReal magnitude used by
orientation-independent bounds, with a proved bridge between the two views.

  /-- `emb` identifies `M'` with a subset of `M`. This is what makes the oracle's uniform draw on
  `M'` a uniform draw on a subset of cardinality `|M'|`: without injectivity the pushforward need
  not be uniform on its image, and the image need not have cardinality `|M'|`. No definition or
  proof in this module uses the field; it is a side condition carried for the reductions that state
  bounds in `|M'|`, as in `TweakableHash.SM_DT_PRE_Problem`. -/

/-- One distributional hypothesis of a quantitative bound in `|M'|`: the hidden input is uniform
on the subspace, with full support. Keeping it separate from the game permits a more general
definition while making the reduction's additional hypothesis explicit.

Uniformity is asked of the subspace rather than of `M`, which is what lets a bound of the form
`q / |M'|` refer to a strict `M' ⊊ M`. Such a bound also requires the appropriate ideal-output
distribution, oracle model, and query budget. Compare
`TweakableHash.SM_DT_OpenPRE_SourceFinalValidity.Problem.HasUniformInputs`, whose game samples from
the full message space and whose uniformity hypothesis is therefore the one on `M`. -/
