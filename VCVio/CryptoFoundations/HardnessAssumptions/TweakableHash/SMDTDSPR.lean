# Single-function, distinct-tweak, multi-target decisional second-preimage resistance (SM-DT-DSPR)

The adversary first selects up to `numTargets` targets through an oracle evaluating the tweakable
hash at a public seed it does not know, then learns the seed, names one of its targets, and
predicts whether that target has a second preimage. It may evaluate the other members of the
collection throughout, through `collectionOracle`. This is the same two-phase shape as SM-DT-TCR,
with the forging phase replaced by a decisional guess:
`SM_DT_DSPR_Adversary.guess : State → PkSeed → ProbComp (ℕ × Bool)` returns a target index and a
predicted bit rather than a colliding message.

Shortened to `SM-DSPR` in the prose below; the declaration names keep the full label.

`numTargets` bounds the accepted challenge queries and is the only query bound the game carries,
enforced by rejecting an over-cap or tweak-reusing query with `none` — the same discipline
`SM_DT_TCR_challengeOracle` uses. See `TweakableHash.collectionOracle` for why the tweak
restrictions are enforced in the oracles rather than in the winning condition.

The security quantity is **not** raw prediction success. `SM_DT_DSPR_SPExperiment` is the source
proof's `SPprob` baseline: it runs the same adversary, including target selection and the guess
phase, but accepts exactly when the named target has a second preimage, independently of the
guessed bit. `SM_DT_DSPR_Advantage` is the truncated difference `Pr[DSPR] - Pr[SPprob]` in `ℝ≥0∞` —
the same triple `SM_DT_DSPR_SourceFinalValidity` already defines, reused unchanged here because the
baseline is a property of what counts as winning, not of how a rejected query is handled.
`SecondPreimageExists` and its `Decidable` instance are imported from `SMDTDSPRFinalValidity`, not
restated.

HK22 Definition 6 and BDHMS24 Figures 8–9 both present SM-DT-DSPR only with final-validity
semantics: distinctness of target tweaks is a post-hoc `DIST` conjunct checked once after the
guess, not a per-query rejection. Neither paper, nor DKKW (whose §3.1 supplies the
rejection-on-arrival discipline this library already uses for SM-DT-TCR and SM-DT-PRE), presents a
rejection-on-arrival decisional second-preimage game — there is no numbered definition to
transcribe here. This file applies that same rejection discipline to HK22's decisional
second-preimage game, for symmetry with its final-validity sibling; the game below is new to this
library, not a transcription of a numbered definition in the cited sources.

been spent on the collection oracle; a rejected query leaves the state untouched.

target. -/
