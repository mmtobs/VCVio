# Single-function, distinct-tweak, multi-target target-collision resistance with random sampling

The message space splits as a product `M × R`: the adversary supplies the message part, and the
challenge oracle draws the randomness part itself, resampling until the digest satisfies a predicate
`prop`. Winning means colliding with a recorded digest under the same tweak, at a `(message,
randomness)` pair different from the recorded one.

Shortened to `SM-rTCR` in the prose below; the declaration names keep the full label.

This is the notion behind a *randomized, failure-prone* encoding: the signer re-hashes a message
against fresh randomness until the encoding succeeds, and `prop` is the success test. It bounds the
probability that an adversary finds two messages with the same encoding.

## One phase, and where the hardness comes from

SM-TCR and SM-PRE withhold the public seed while the adversary selects targets, and remove the
challenge oracle once the seed is revealed. SM-rTCR does neither: the seed is an *input* to the
adversary, and the challenge oracle stays available through to its output. So the adversary is a
single field with no private state to carry between phases, and `unifSpec` is part of its oracle
bundle because there is no oracle-free second phase to hold its private randomness.

Hardness comes instead from the randomness `ρ` that the challenge oracle draws and reveals only in
its answer. Colliding with a recorded digest still requires hitting a value the adversary did not
choose.

## Resampling, and the two kinds of rejection

`SM_DT_RTCR_resample` is the paper's bounded loop, as structural recursion on the attempt budget:
draw `ρ`, evaluate, and answer as soon as the digest satisfies `prop`. At `numRetries = 0` it draws
nothing and answers `none`.

Both rejections a caller sees are `none`, and they differ in the history:

* at the target cap, or on a tweak already recorded, *nothing* is recorded;
* when resampling is exhausted, `(tweak, message, none)` *is* recorded, so the slot takes an index
  and consumes one of the `numTargets` targets.

The second is a formalization decision rather than a transcription: the paper inserts
`(T, M, ⊥)` and then indexes into a history holding that entry, without saying what `ρⱼ = ⊥` means
in the winning condition. `SM_DT_RTCR_IsForgery` gives an exhausted slot its own losing arm, since
there is no recorded pair to differ from and no recorded digest to collide with.

## Winning on the pair

The winning condition asks `(M*, ρ*) ≠ (Mⱼ, ρⱼ)`, not `M* ≠ Mⱼ`. Reusing the recorded message with
*fresh randomness* is a legitimate win, which is what separates this notion from SM-TCR, where the
challenge oracle draws nothing and the recorded message is the whole recorded input.

The paper writes the `j`-th history entry as `(Mⱼ, Tⱼ, ρⱼ)` where its own insertion step writes
`(T, M, ρ)`; the field order here follows the insertion step.

## No collection oracle

Every other game in this directory carries a `TweakableHashCollection` and a collection oracle, and
this one deliberately does not. The collection oracle exists because the stand-alone notions hand
the public parameters to the adversary only after all challenge queries are made, so it cannot
evaluate other members of the family itself. Definition 6 hands the seed over up front, so
`Th^λ(P, ·, ·)` would give the adversary nothing it cannot already compute. The parameter would be
provably inert.

The tweak discipline is still shared: `TweakReserved` is the same predicate the collection-carrying
games test against their challenge history, at `tweakOf := Prod.fst`.

## No final-validity form

There is no source-final-validity sibling of this module, because no source states one. Definition 6
is unambiguously rejection-on-arrival — its oracle returns `⊥` and leaves the history untouched —
and the framework that motivates the sticky-monitor presentation has no randomized-sampling notion
to present.

## Special cases

At `numRetries = 1` with `prop` constantly true this is multi-target extended target-collision
resistance with nonce, and it is also the hypothesis of the Winternitz encoding's target-collision
resistance. The target-sum Winternitz encoding needs both parameters non-trivial: `prop` tests
membership of the target-sum codeword set, and `numRetries` is the rejection-sampling budget.

## Query bounds

`numTargets` is the paper's `p`, the cap on challenge queries, and `numRetries` is its `K`, the
number of hash evaluations the challenge oracle may make per query. The paper's `q`, the number of
evaluations the *adversary* makes, is a quantity of the heuristic random-oracle analysis rather than
a parameter of the game; the bounds there are stated in `q' = q + pK`, which is why `K` has to be
visible in the game at all.

/-- The challenge oracle at a public seed. A query is rejected with `none`, and leaves the history
untouched, when the target cap is reached or when its tweak is already recorded. Otherwise the
oracle resamples and records a slot either way: the randomness it used on success, and `none` in its
place on exhaustion.

Recording the answer's randomness with `Option.map Prod.snd` is what makes an exhausted slot consume
a target by construction rather than by a separate branch.

Accepted queries are appended, so the history is in issue order and its `j`-th entry is the `j`-th
target. -/
