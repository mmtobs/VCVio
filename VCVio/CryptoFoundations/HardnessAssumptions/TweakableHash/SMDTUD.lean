# Single-function, distinct-tweak, multi-target undetectability (SM-DT-UD)

SM-DT-UD asks an adversary to distinguish sampled images of one tweakable hash from samples of an
explicit output distribution. The public seed is sampled by the experiment and withheld while the
adversary selects target tweaks through the challenge oracle and evaluates the shared hash
collection. The seed is revealed only after those oracles have been removed, and the adversary then
names the world it was answered from.

Shortened to `SM-UD` in the prose below; the declaration names keep the full label.

In the real world, a challenge at `t` samples `x ← inputGen` from the subspace `M'` and returns
`th.eval pk t (emb x)`. In the ideal world it returns `y ← outputGen`. The two worlds differ in
nothing else: `SM_DT_UD_response` is the only world-indexed definition, and the tweak discipline,
the recording, and the refusal test are shared.

The tweak discipline is enforced on arrival. The challenge oracle answers `Option Y` and returns
`none` — the source's `⊥` — when the target cap is reached, when the queried tweak already occurs
in the challenge history, or when it has been spent on the collection oracle; a refused query
leaves the state untouched and **draws nothing**, so refusal consumes no randomness in either
world. That last point is what makes the two worlds' refusal behaviour literally the same term, and
it is pinned by `SM_DT_UD_challengeOracle_run_of_refused`. See `TweakableHash.collectionOracle` for
why the restrictions live in the oracles rather than in the winning condition, and
`TweakableHash.SM_DT_UD_SourceFinalValidity` for the sticky-monitor presentation of the same
notion, which answers every query and checks the discipline once at the end.

`numTargets` bounds the accepted challenge queries and is the only query bound the game carries. It
is the source's `p`, the number of classical challenge-oracle queries; the source's `q`, the number
of queries to the hash function itself, is a quantity of the random-oracle analysis in which `Th`
is an oracle rather than a function, and is not a parameter of this game.

The subspace the hidden input is drawn from is carried as its own type `M'` together with an
injective `emb : M' → M`, matching `TweakableHash.SM_DT_PRE_Problem`. A subspace carved out of `M`
by a predicate is the case `M' := Subtype p`, `emb := Subtype.val` (`Subtype.val_injective`); the
unrestricted notion is recovered exactly at `M' := M`, `emb := id` (`Function.injective_id`), so
the parameterization costs no generality. It buys the ability to state bounds in `|M'|` rather than
`|M|`: `SM_DT_UD_Problem.HasUniformInputs` fixes `inputGen` to the uniform distribution on the
subspace, which is what a quantitative bound of the form `q / |M'|` needs, and
`SM_DT_UD_Problem.HasUniformOutputs` fixes the ideal response to the uniform distribution on `Y`.

The security quantity is oriented: `SM_DT_UD_DirectedAdvantage` is the signed real gap
`Pr[real = true] - Pr[ideal = true]`. It can be negative, so swapping the real and ideal worlds is
observable. `SM_DT_UD_AbsoluteAdvantage` separately provides the symmetric `ℝ≥0∞` magnitude used by
orientation-independent bounds, with a proved bridge between the two views.

distribution and recording the queried tweak in the challenge history. A query is refused with
`none` when the target cap is reached, when its tweak already occurs in the challenge history, or
when its tweak has been spent on the collection oracle.

The refusal test is read off the state *before* anything is drawn, and the refusing branch is a
`pure`: a refused query leaves the state untouched and consumes no randomness. That asymmetry
between the two branches is deliberate and load-bearing. If refusal drew from the response
distribution, it would draw a different amount in the two worlds whenever `inputGen` and
`outputGen` differ in length, and the advantage would then charge the adversary for randomness it
never observed.

Accepted queries are appended, so the history is in issue order and its `j`-th entry is the `j`-th

/-! ## The refusing branch

Refusal is world-independent and draws nothing. The general statement is
`SM_DT_UD_challengeOracle_run_of_refused`, whose right-hand side is a `pure` at an arbitrary world;
the three named causes are its corollaries. -/

/-- A refused query returns `none`, leaves the state untouched, and draws nothing — in either
world, from the same term.

This is the game's central convention and no build gate can see it. Both worlds are covered by one
statement because `world` is universally quantified, and the right-hand side is a `pure`, so no
sample of `SM_DT_UD_response` is taken. Were the draw hoisted above the refusal test, the two
worlds would consume different amounts of randomness on a refused query while returning the same
`none`, and `SM_DT_UD_DirectedAdvantage` would no longer measure what the adversary can observe. -/

statement true. Stating it at an arbitrary `world` covers both worlds at once, and keeping both
draws on the right-hand side pins that the first accepted query samples even though its answer is
discarded. -/
