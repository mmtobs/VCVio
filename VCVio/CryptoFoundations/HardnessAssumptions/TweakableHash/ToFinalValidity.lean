# Converting rejection-on-arrival adversaries to source-final-validity adversaries

The rejection-on-arrival games and the source-final-validity games enforce the same tweak discipline
at different times: the first rejects a violating query as it arrives and leaves the state
untouched, the second answers every query and conjoins a sticky monitor into the winning condition.
The two families have distinct adversary types, so an adversary against one is not an adversary
against the other.

This file relates them in the direction a reduction needs, one conversion per game: an explicit map
sending an adversary against the rejection-on-arrival game to an adversary against the corresponding
source-final-validity game with *the same* success probability. `SM_DT_TCR_*` and `SM_DT_PRE_*` are
covered; the same construction applies to any further pair of games sharing this shape.

Each game contributes `Problem.toSourceFinalValidity`, `Adversary.toSourceFinalValidity`, and the
three theorems `..._experiment_toSourceFinalValidity`, `..._advantage_toSourceFinalValidity` and
`..._advantage_le_toSourceFinalValidity`.

The construction itself lives in `TweakableHash.ToFinalValidity`, stated over a challenge oracle
given by what it draws, records and answers. A game appears here as a choice of that data together
with two `rfl` equations identifying its own oracles with the generic ones, so the wrapper, the
coupling invariant and the run-level agreement are shared rather than repeated per game. SM-TCR
draws nothing and records the queried pair; SM-PRE draws its message from the subspace and records
the queried tweak alongside it.

The wrapper is a handler holding a replica of the two tweak histories. It evaluates the acceptance
test itself and, on a query its rejection-on-arrival counterpart would refuse, answers `none`
**without querying**. The suppressed query is exactly the one that would have poisoned the monitor,
so the monitor stays valid and the two runs couple exactly — hence an equality of advantages, with
the inequality as a corollary.

/-! ## SM-DT-PRE

The same construction, at the game whose challenge oracle draws its own message: the drawn-value
type is the subspace `M'`, a query is a tweak alone, and the recorded entry pairs it with the draw.
The wrapper never learns the drawn message — it only ever sees the digest — which is why the replica
records tweaks alone; the projection reads the drawn messages back out of the monitor's own
history. -/
