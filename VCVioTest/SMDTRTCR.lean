# SM-DT-rTCR canaries

These concrete games pin the parts of the definition that no build gate can see: that a win is
claimed on the `(message, randomness)` pair rather than on the message, that an exhausted slot loses
but still consumes a target, and that the history is in issue order.

The probe hash discards its randomness part, so every pair sharing a message collides. That is what
makes the same-message win observable at all.
